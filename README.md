# Fast10
 Batch and registry files for an express installation of Windows 10 21h2
 
 ## Building
 
 To build the ISO, you need ImgBurn, or another iso creator. Copy the files that aren't GitHub files to you computer and add them to the ISO. Do not make it bootable.
 
 ## Running
 
 To run this in VMWare or VirtualBox you need to have 2 virtual CD-ROM drives to put 2 ISOs in. The first one being the Windows 10 21h2 setup and the ISO that you downloaded or created. By default, the drive with the express install files is on drive E: or D: . To do the installation, you have to follow the instructions in the bat file. 
 
 ### Extra notes

To open command prompt, **do not click setup then repair my computer.** It is much easier and intended to use the shortcut SHIFT+F10
