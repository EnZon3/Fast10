Windows 10 Express Installer

Script created by EnZon3. Original speedrun by Endermanch, all I did was just transcribe the speedrun into an executable script(s).

If you're not sure what to do, this is a good place to start:

    Step 1 - Run part1.bat and follow the instructions provided inside the file.
    Step 2 - After restarting the computer, and while the installer is loading services, open the command prompt using an exploit and run part2.bat, and follow the instructions provided inside the file.
    Step 3 - After the third restart, skip the OOBE using the key combo Ctrl+Shift+F3. After that, run OOBESkip.bat and it will automatically reboot you into a working OS (if all goes well.)

If you would like to make a video about my installer, you are free to make one, just PLEASE credit me like this:
