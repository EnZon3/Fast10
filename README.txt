Windows 10 Express Installer

Script created by EnZon3. Original speedrun by Endermanch, all I did was just transcribe the speedrun into an executable script(s).

If you're not sure what to do, this is a good place to start:

    Step 1 - Run part1.bat and follow the instructions provided inside the file.
    Step 2 - After restarting the computer, and while the installer is loading services, open the command prompt using an exploit and run part2.bat, and follow the instructions provided inside the file.
    Step 3 - After the third restart, skip the OOBE using the key combo Ctrl+Shift+F3. After that, run OOBESkip.bat and it will automatically reboot you into a working OS (if all goes well.)
    
    batch file to run part 1: part1.bat 
    batch file to run part 2: part2.bat
    batch file to skip OOBE: OOBESkip.bat (you can run this in file explorer but command prompt is recommended)

If you would like to make a video about my installer, you are free to make one, just PLEASE credit me like this:

--NOTES--

    [-] DO NOT RUN THIS ON ACTUAL HARDWARE! I can't belive I have to say this but you can lose data if you do, so please run this in a virtual machine.
    [+] This script is for Windows 10 21H2 only.
    [-] This script will not work on Windows 10 20H2 or earlier.
    [-] This script is not fully tested.
    [+] This script is semi-automated.
    [ ] If you don't know what you're doing, don't run this script. You're better off using the regular installer. It's much more reliable, and this script is just a proof of concept.
